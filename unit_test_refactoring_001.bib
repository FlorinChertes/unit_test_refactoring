abstract="It is suggested that test-driven development (TDD) is one of the most fundamental practices in agile software development, which produces loosely coupled and highly cohesive code. However, how the TDD impacts on the structure of the program code have not been widely studied. This paper presents the results from a comparative case study of five small scale software development projects where the effect of TDD on program design was studied using both traditional and package level metrics. The empirical results reveal that an unwanted side effect can be that some parts of the code may deteriorate. In addition, the differences in the program code, between TDD and the iterative test-last development, were not as clear as expected. This raises the question as to whether the possible benefits of TDD are greater than the possible downsides. Moreover, it additionally questions whether the same benefits could be achieved just by emphasizing unit-level testing activities.",

@book{Meszaros07,
  abstract = {Automated testing is a cornerstone of agile development. An effective testing strategy will deliver new functionality more aggressively, accelerate user feedback, and improve quality. However, for many developers, creating effective automated tests is a unique and unfamiliar challenge. xUnit Test Patterns is the definitive guide to writing automated tests using xUnit, the most popular unit testing framework in use today. Agile coach and test automation expert Gerard Meszaros describes 68 proven patterns for making tests easier to write, understand, and maintain. He then shows you how to make them more robust and repeatable--and far more cost-effective. Loaded with information, this book feels like three books in one. The first part is a detailed tutorial on test automation that covers everything from test strategy to in-depth test coding. The second part, a catalog of 18 frequently encountered test smells, provides trouble-shooting guidelines to help you determine the root cause of problems and the most applicable patterns. The third part contains detailed descriptions of each pattern, including refactoring instructions illustrated by extensive code samples in multiple programming languages.},
